# open images

Learn how to use T4 for your image classification pipelines by building an image dataset builder in this (still in progress) example package.

### data

The [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) is an enormous image dataset intended for use in machine learning projects. A Google project, V1 of this dataset was [initially released](https://ai.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-open-images-dataset.html) in late 2016. This repository and project is based on V4 of the data.

The Open Images Dataset is an attractive target for building image recognition algorithms because it is one of the largest, most accurate, and most easily accessible image recognition datasets. For image recognition tasks, Open Images contains 15 million bounding boxes for 600 categories of objects on 1.75 million images. Image labeling tasks meanwhile enjoy 30 million labels across almost 20,000 categories.

The images are of highly variable quality, as would be realistic in an applied machine learning setting. All or most come from Flickr. Here is an example image from this dataset, taken completely at random:

### summaries

This package comes equipped with a summary. Summaries let you render files like Markdown documents, Vega visualizations, and Jupyter notebooks inline in the catalog browser, making it easier for you to share critical information about your pacakge with your users.

### code

To get started with the code, navigate to a notebook still TBD.
